FCC Image Search API Challenge

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images, and then deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

<ul>
                    <li>User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.</li>
                    
                    <li>User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.</li>
                    
                    <li>User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.</li>
                </ul>
